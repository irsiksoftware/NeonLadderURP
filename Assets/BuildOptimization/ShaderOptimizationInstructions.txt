SHADER OPTIMIZATION INSTRUCTIONS:

1. MANUAL APPROACH (Recommended):
   - Go to Project Settings → Graphics
   - At bottom, find 'Shader Stripping'
   - Enable 'Strip Unused' and configure variants

2. QUALITY SETTINGS:
   - Go to Project Settings → Quality
   - Create a 'Development' quality level with minimal settings

3. SHADER VARIANT COLLECTION:
   - Window → Rendering → Shader Variant Collection
   - Create new collection, add only shaders you use

4. GRAPHICS SETTINGS:
   - Project Settings → Graphics → Built-in Shader Settings
   - Disable shaders you don't use (like terrain, speedtree, etc.)

Your project has ~200 shaders. For a Title scene, you probably need <10.

FASTEST APPROACH:
1. Run 'NeonLadder → Build → Shader Analysis → Find ARTnGAME Shaders'
2. Consider removing ARTnGAME packages you don't use
3. Use 'Ultra Fast Development Build' with 1 scene
