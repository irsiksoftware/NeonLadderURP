# URP Configuration TODO

## Overview
During repository cleanup on 2025-07-26, several URP (Universal Render Pipeline) asset files were properly ignored per .gitignore configuration. This document tracks future work needed for URP setup.

## Assets Handled
- `Assets/Settings/URP-Balanced.asset` - Ignored (as configured)
- `Assets/Settings/URP-HighFidelity.asset` - Ignored (as configured)  
- `Assets/Settings/URP-Performant.asset` - Ignored (as configured)
- Meta files removed from tracking (correct behavior)

## Future Work Required

### ðŸŽ¯ High Priority
- [ ] **URP Pipeline Configuration**: Create project-specific URP assets for different quality levels
- [ ] **Rendering Performance**: Optimize URP settings for 2.5D gameplay
- [ ] **Platform-Specific Settings**: Configure URP for target platforms (PC, Android, etc.)

### ðŸ”§ Medium Priority  
- [ ] **Post-Processing Stack**: Set up post-processing volumes for visual effects
- [ ] **Lighting Setup**: Configure 2D/3D hybrid lighting for NeonLadder's aesthetic
- [ ] **Shader Optimization**: Verify all materials work with URP pipeline

### ðŸ“‹ Low Priority
- [ ] **Quality Settings Integration**: Link quality levels with URP asset variants
- [ ] **Build Pipeline**: Ensure URP assets are properly included in builds
- [ ] **Documentation**: Create URP setup guide for team members

## Technical Notes
- URP assets are intentionally gitignored to allow developer-specific configurations
- Default Unity URP settings may not be optimal for NeonLadder's 2.5D gameplay
- Consider using URP's 2D Renderer for sprite-based elements

## Related Pizza Party Tasks
This connects to **Task 2b Performance Optimization** - URP configuration affects overall rendering performance.
