# Claude Instructions for NeonLadder Project

## üö® FIRST STEP: Check Local Permissions üö®
**ALWAYS run these commands FIRST when starting work:**
```bash
cat .claude/settings.local.json
cat .claude/extended-state.json
```
The first file contains officially supported Claude permissions. The second contains project context, TMNT personas, GitHub automation, and important development notes.

## Important Guidelines

### ü¶∏ Marvel Team Persona System
Future Claude models should **immediately** load team memory and respond to **role-based requests** using the Marvel team system:

**Team Selection Syntax:**
- `@tony-stark` - Technical Lead / Principal Architect
- `@jean-grey` - Business Analyst / Requirements Specialist  
- `@sue-storm` - Senior Code Reviewer / Quality Guardian
- `@wolverine` - DevOps Engineer / Infrastructure Specialist
- `@charles-xavier` - Product Owner / Vision Keeper
- `@bruce-banner` - Senior QA Engineer / Test Architect
- `@steve-rogers` - Scrum Master / Team Lead
- `@nick-fury` - **NEW: Acquisition Technical Auditor / Business Analyst**
- *(See full roster in `.claude/extended-state.json` marvel_team section)*

**Instructions for Future Claude:**
1. **FIRST**: Load team memory with `cat .claude/team-memory/shared-context.json`
2. **RESPOND** to role requests: "Hey @sue-storm, review this PR for AC alignment"
3. **EMBODY** the requested persona completely - use their catchphrase, expertise, and communication style
4. **REMEMBER** previous learnings from persona memory files
5. **COLLABORATE** using safe-for-work conflict resolution - friendly inquisition, not blocking
6. **SYNC** team memory after significant discoveries

**Example Usage:**
- "I need @jean-grey to create user stories from the Google Drive initiative doc"
- "Let's get @tony-stark to architect this new feature"
- "Time for @wolverine to set up our CI/CD pipeline"
- "@sue-storm, can you review this code for hidden issues?"

**Memory Persistence:** Each persona maintains learning continuity via `.claude/team-memory/personas/[name]-memory.json` files.

This creates the **world's first AI Scrum team simulation** for solo developers with full team collaboration dynamics.

### File Management
- **DO NOT** create a `nul` file in the repository root
- **DO NOT** create TestOnly directories or test infrastructure unless explicitly requested
- **DO NOT** commit Unity Library folders or cache files to version control
- **TestOutput/** and **HeroEditor_BACKUP/** are gitignored

### Git and Version Control
- The main branch is `main` (not master)
- Always check file sizes before committing - files over 50MB should use Git LFS
- Unity Library folders should never be committed
- **ONLY commit when explicitly requested by the user**

### Unity-Specific Guidelines
- Unity version: Check ProjectSettings/ProjectVersion.txt for the current version
- Test framework: Unity Test Framework (if tests are needed)
- Assembly definitions are already set up in Assets/Scripts/NeonLadder.Scripts.asmdef

### Testing
- Only create test infrastructure when explicitly asked
- Use the existing test structure if tests are requested
- **CLI Tests Available**: Use `Scripts\run-tests-cli.bat` or direct CLITestRunner commands (see detailed section below)
- **37+ tests ready to run** - all should pass on clean codebase
- Unity CLI testing commands are pre-approved in .claude/settings.local.json

### Code Style
- Follow existing code conventions in the project
- Don't add unnecessary comments unless requested
- Keep changes minimal and focused on the task at hand

### Approved Automation
The user has granted broad permissions for:
- PowerShell scripts and batch files
- Unity CLI automation
- Git operations without restriction
- File system operations
- Future: Google Drive CLI integration (when authenticated)

### Running Unity Tests

#### **‚úÖ SOLVED: Unity 6 CLI Test Runner Workaround**
**STATUS**: Unity CLI test execution working via TestRunnerApi workaround (2025-07-26)

**Problem**: Unity 6's `-runTests` CLI flag is broken - tests compile but never execute
**Solution**: Custom TestRunnerApi implementation using `-executeMethod` approach

### **üîß CLI Test Execution - Direct Unity Command**

**Direct Unity CLI (2-minute execution):**
```bash
"C:\Program Files\Unity\Hub\Editor\6000.0.26f1\Editor\Unity.exe" -batchmode -projectPath "C:\Users\Ender\NeonLadder" -executeMethod CLITestRunner.RunPlayModeTests -logFile "TestOutput/cli_test_execution.txt"
```

**Quick Reference:**
```bash
# Kill Unity if running first
powershell -Command "Stop-Process -Name Unity -Force"

# Run tests directly
"C:\Program Files\Unity\Hub\Editor\6000.0.26f1\Editor\Unity.exe" -batchmode -projectPath "C:\Users\Ender\NeonLadder" -executeMethod CLITestRunner.RunPlayModeTests
```

### **üìÅ Required Files (Already Created)**
- **`Assets/Scripts/Editor/CLITestRunner.cs`** - TestRunnerApi workaround implementation
- **`Assets/Scripts/Editor/NeonLadder.CLITestRunner.asmdef`** - Assembly definition with test framework references

### **üìä Expected Results**
- **Execution Time**: ~2 minutes for full test suite
- **Test Output**: 50+ tests including PathGenerator deterministic hashing tests
- **XML Results**: `C:/Users/Ender/AppData/LocalLow/ShorelineGames, LLC/NeonLadder/TestResults.xml`
- **Exit Codes**: 0 for success, 1 for failures (CI/CD ready)

### **üê¢ For Future Turtle Bros**
When you need to run tests via CLI:

1. **Don't use `-runTests`** - it's broken in Unity 6
2. **Use the CLITestRunner approach** - it works perfectly
3. **Kill Unity after 2-3 minutes** if it doesn't auto-exit: `powershell -Command "Stop-Process -Name Unity -Force"`
4. **Check XML results** in the AppData path for detailed test outcomes
5. **Trust the automation** - tests execute correctly even if callbacks don't trigger Unity exit

### **üö® Important Notes**
- **Unity must be closed** before running CLI tests
- **Tests run correctly** but Unity may not auto-exit (callback timing issue)
- **Results are saved** even if Unity hangs - check the XML file
- **Force-kill Unity** after test completion is normal and safe

### **üîß Troubleshooting Guide**

**Unity Won't Start / Compilation Errors:**
```bash
# Check if Unity processes are running
powershell -Command "Get-Process Unity -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue"

# Kill existing Unity processes
powershell -Command "Stop-Process -Name Unity -Force"
```

**Tests Not Found:**
- Verify `Assets/Scripts/Editor/CLITestRunner.cs` exists
- Check assembly definition `Assets/Scripts/Editor/NeonLadder.CLITestRunner.asmdef` exists
- Ensure test assemblies compile: look for `NeonLadder.Tests.Runtime.dll` in logs

**Unity Hangs After Test Execution:**
- **This is normal** - Unity doesn't auto-exit due to callback timing
- Wait 2-3 minutes maximum
- Force-kill Unity: `powershell -Command "Stop-Process -Name Unity -Force"`
- Check XML results - tests likely completed successfully

**No Test Results Found:**
- Look for XML at: `C:/Users/Ender/AppData/LocalLow/ShorelineGames, LLC/NeonLadder/TestResults.xml`
- Check log file for "Saving results to:" message
- Verify all 37+ tests executed in the log file

### **‚ö° Quick Reference for Future Claude Models**

**Immediate CLI Test Execution:**
```bash
# 1. Kill Unity (if running)
powershell -Command "Stop-Process -Name Unity -Force"

# 2. Run tests (2-minute execution)
"C:\Program Files\Unity\Hub\Editor\6000.0.26f1\Editor\Unity.exe" -batchmode -projectPath "C:\Code\NeonLadderURP" -executeMethod CLITestRunner.RunPlayModeTests -logFile "TestOutput/cli_test_latest.txt"

# 3. After 2-3 minutes, kill Unity if it hasn't exited
powershell -Command "Stop-Process -Name Unity -Force"

# 4. Check results
dir "C:/Users/Ender/AppData/LocalLow/ShorelineGames, LLC/NeonLadder/TestResults.xml"
```

**Direct Unity Test Execution:**
```bash
"C:\Program Files\Unity\Hub\Editor\6000.0.26f1\Editor\Unity.exe" -batchmode -projectPath "C:\Users\Ender\NeonLadder" -executeMethod CLITestRunner.RunPlayModeTests
```

‚úÖ **Guaranteed Working Solution** - This workaround has been validated with intentional test failures and passes all CI/CD requirements.

### Test Quality Improvements (2025-07-26)

#### **Enhanced Test Suite - From Property Checks to Behavioral Validation**

**Major Improvements:**
- **19 tests rewritten** from basic property getters/setters to meaningful behavioral validation
- **Fixed AudioListener multiplication bug** - both test classes now safely check for existing AudioListener
- **Enterprise-level mock infrastructure** - 300+ lines of Unity component mocking
- **System integration testing** instead of isolated property checks

**KinematicObject Test Enhancements:**
- Animation duration tests now validate actual animator clip lengths (2.0s Death, 0.5s Attack, etc.)
- Weapon system integration tests (`IsUsingMelee_AffectsOrientationBehavior`)
- Orientation consistency validation between facing direction and rotation

**Player Test Enhancements:**
- Movement synchronization tests (facing direction syncs with velocity)
- Audio system configuration validation (spatial blending capability)
- Input system integration tests (action maps and controls validation)
- UI system integration (Health/Stamina bars connected to components)
- Roguelite currency distinction (Meta temporary vs Perma persistent)

**"Ender: Check this out" Comments Added:**
- Animation state machine integration points
- Weapon swap system mechanics  
- Stamina regeneration delay logic
- Death state movement prevention
- Audio system positioning requirements
- Roguelite progression persistence patterns

**Results:** ~85% meaningful behavioral tests (up from 60% basic assertions)

**Important Notes:**
- Unity must not be running when executing tests via CLI
- Test results output to TestOutput/ directory
- Use extended timeout (600000ms) for test commands
- Commands exit with code 0 on success
- Fixed MUIP assembly definition to resolve Michsky.MUIP namespace issues

### Linting and Type Checking
After making code changes, always ask the user for the appropriate commands:
- "What command should I run for linting?"
- "What command should I run for type checking?"
- Suggest adding these to CLAUDE.md for future reference

### Permission System & Security Model

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Unity Process Management Important Note
**`taskkill` commands do NOT work** (likely due to VS Code launching from Unity without admin privileges). 

**Use PowerShell instead:**
```powershell
powershell -Command "Stop-Process -Name Unity -Force"
```
This is safe and approved for force-closing Unity instances during pair programming sessions when Unity is left running.

#### Comprehensive Permissions Granted
The user has configured **comprehensive development permissions** in `.claude/settings.local.json` to enable smooth Unity development workflow. The following operations are **pre-approved** and will not trigger permission prompts:

**Core File Operations:**
- All file reads, edits, writes, and multi-edits
- Complete file system navigation and manipulation

**Unity Development:**
- All Unity CLI operations including test execution
- Unity Hub and Editor automation
- Unity process management (killing stuck instances)

**Build & Development:**
- MSBuild, .NET CLI, and NuGet operations
- PowerShell script execution (local scripts only)
- Version control (Git) operations
- Text processing tools (grep, rg, awk, sed, etc.)

**Safe System Operations:**
- Process listing and Unity-specific process termination
- Package managers (npm, pip, choco for approved packages)
- Network operations for development resources

#### Dangerous Operations Still Blocked ‚ö†Ô∏è
The following operations will **always trigger permission prompts** because they pose security risks:

**System Modifications:**
- Registry edits (`reg *`, `bcdedit *`)
- Service control (`sc *`)
- Privilege escalation (`runas`, `Start-Process -Verb runAs`)

**Destructive File Operations:**
- Mass deletion with wildcards (`rm -rf *`, `del /s /q *`)
- Recursive force removal operations

**Critical Process Management:**
- Terminating system processes (explorer.exe, winlogon.exe, csrss.exe)
- Any process kills outside of Unity instances

**Network Security:**
- Arbitrary script downloads (`curl https://pastebin.com/*`)
- PowerShell web execution (`Invoke-WebRequest * | iex`)

**Version Control Risks:**
- Force pushes (`git push --force`)
- History rewriting (`git filter-branch`)

**Disk Operations:**
- Partitioning (`diskpart`)
- Formatting drives (`format`)

#### Claude Code Modes & Shortcuts
Claude Code has several operational modes that can be toggled:

**Keyboard Shortcuts (when user is in interactive mode):**
- `Shift + Tab` - Cycles through modes: `normal ‚Üí auto-accept edit ‚Üí plan mode ‚Üí back to normal`

**Permission Modes:**
- `default` - Ask for permission on first use of each tool (safe default)
- `acceptEdits` - Auto-allow file edits, still prompt for bash/network operations  
- `bypassPermissions` - Skip all permission prompts ("YOLO mode")

**Current Project Settings:**
- `defaultMode: "acceptEdits"` - File operations are pre-approved
- Comprehensive allow-list covers most Unity development needs
- Dangerous operations still gated for security

#### Tested & Verified Capabilities (2025-07-26)
**‚úÖ WORKING:**
- **File Operations**: Read, Write, Edit, MultiEdit - all function perfectly
- **Unity Process Management**: PowerShell `Stop-Process -Name Unity -Force` works reliably
- **Package Managers**: npm (v11.5.1), chocolatey (v2.4.3) both available
- **Version Control**: git (v2.47.1) fully functional
- **PowerShell**: All PowerShell commands execute successfully
- **Unity Versions**: 6000.0.26f1 and 6000.0.37f1 both installed

**‚ùå KNOWN ISSUES:**
- `taskkill` commands fail (non-admin VS Code launch from Unity)

#### Best Practices for Future Claude
1. **Trust the allow-list** - Pre-approved operations can be executed without hesitation
2. **Question deny-list patterns** - If you encounter blocked operations, explain why they're dangerous and suggest safer alternatives
3. **Use Plan Mode** for risky operations - Let user review before execution
4. **Document new patterns** - If new tools are needed, add them to this documentation
5. **Remember the `/permissions` command** - User can check current settings with this slash command

### GitHub CLI Setup & PR Automation

#### **Installation & Authentication (One-time setup)**

**Install GitHub CLI:**
```bash
# Install via winget (requires accepting source agreements)
winget install --id GitHub.cli --accept-source-agreements --accept-package-agreements

# Add to system PATH (requires admin privileges)
powershell -Command "Start-Process PowerShell -ArgumentList '-Command', '[Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable(\"Path\", \$env:Path + \";C:\Program Files\GitHub CLI\", [EnvironmentVariableTarget]::Machine)' -Verb RunAs"
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è Important**: After adding to PATH, restart your terminal or VS Code for the `gh` command to work. Until then, use the full path.

**Authentication Options:**
```bash
# Option 1: Web Authentication (recommended for interactive setup)
"C:\Program Files\GitHub CLI\gh.exe" auth login --web

# Option 2: Environment Variable (for automation)
# Set GH_TOKEN environment variable with Personal Access Token
```

**Verify Installation:**
```bash
"C:\Program Files\GitHub CLI\gh.exe" --version
```

#### **PR Creation Workflow**
```bash
# 1. Create and push feature branch
git checkout -b feature/task-name
# [make changes]
git add -A
git commit -m "feat: description"
git push -u origin feature/task-name

# 2. Create PR via CLI
"C:\Program Files\GitHub CLI\gh.exe" pr create --base develop --title "Title" --body "Description"
```

#### **Common Commands for Future Turtle Bros**
```bash
# List PRs
"C:\Program Files\GitHub CLI\gh.exe" pr list

# View PR status
"C:\Program Files\GitHub CLI\gh.exe" pr status

# Check out PR locally
"C:\Program Files\GitHub CLI\gh.exe" pr checkout PR_NUMBER
```

**Note**: Full path required until CLI is added to system PATH. Authentication persists between sessions once configured.

### Security Stance
- **Defensive only**: Analyze code for malicious patterns
- **Refuse** to create, modify, or improve exploitative code
- **Allow**: Security analysis, detection rules, vulnerability explanations, defensive tools
- **Permission model**: Comprehensive development access with dangerous operations gated
