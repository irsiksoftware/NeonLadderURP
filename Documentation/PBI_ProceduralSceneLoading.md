# Product Backlog Item: Procedural Scene Loading with Save Integration

## Epic
Save System Enhancement & Procedural Generation Integration

## Story
**As a** game designer and developer  
**I want** a visual tool to configure procedural scene sets and save states  
**So that** I can easily test different game scenarios, set up specific progression states, and create reproducible procedural experiences

## Business Value
- **Designer Productivity**: Drag & drop interface reduces setup time for testing scenarios
- **QA Efficiency**: Reproducible save states enable consistent bug testing  
- **Player Experience**: Seamless save/load with procedural content maintains immersion
- **Development Speed**: Visual configuration tools accelerate iteration cycles

## Priority: High
**MoSCoW: Must Have**

## Story Points: 13
**Complexity: High** (involves multiple systems integration)

## Acceptance Criteria

### AC1: Save State Configuration Tool
**Given** I am a designer working in Unity  
**When** I create a SaveStateConfiguration ScriptableObject  
**Then** I can visually configure:
- Player progression (level, health, stamina, abilities)
- Currency amounts (Meta/Perma)
- Unlocked items and abilities via drag & drop
- Current world state and scene information
- Procedural generation parameters

### AC2: Procedural Scene Set Management
**Given** I have a SaveStateConfiguration  
**When** I configure procedural scene sets  
**Then** I can:
- Define specific seeds for reproducible generation
- Set up predefined scene sequences
- Configure boss placement and special rooms
- Specify player spawn positions for each scene
- Add scene-specific data and parameters

### AC3: Save Data Integration
**Given** I have configured a save state  
**When** I apply the configuration  
**Then** the system:
- Creates a comprehensive JSON save file in GameData directory
- Includes all progression, world state, and procedural generation data
- Maintains backward compatibility with existing saves
- Provides backup and recovery mechanisms

### AC4: Scene Loading with Procedural Data
**Given** I load a save with procedural scene configuration  
**When** the game loads the specified scene  
**Then** the system:
- Applies the correct procedural generation seed
- Positions the player at the saved location
- Restores the correct progression state
- Maintains scene-specific data and state

### AC5: External Save Manipulation
**Given** a save file exists in the GameData directory  
**When** I edit the JSON file externally  
**Then** the game:
- Loads the modified data correctly
- Validates data integrity on load
- Provides fallback to backup if corruption detected
- Maintains performance with large save files

## Technical Tasks

### T1: Enhanced Save System Implementation ✅
- [x] Create ConsolidatedSaveData structure with comprehensive progression tracking
- [x] Implement EnhancedSaveSystem with JSON serialization to GameData directory
- [x] Add backup/recovery mechanisms and error handling
- [x] Include save file metadata and validation

### T2: SaveStateConfiguration ScriptableObject ✅
- [x] Create designer-friendly configuration interface
- [x] Implement drag & drop support for items and unlocks
- [x] Add procedural scene set configuration
- [x] Include testing scenario management

### T3: Procedural Generation Integration
- [ ] Integrate SaveStateConfiguration with existing PathGenerator
- [ ] Implement scene loading with procedural parameters
- [ ] Add scene-specific data persistence
- [ ] Create scene transition manager for procedural content

### T4: Migration and Compatibility
- [ ] Create migration system from old save format
- [ ] Ensure backward compatibility
- [ ] Add version management for save data
- [ ] Test with existing game progression

### T5: Testing and Validation
- [ ] Unit tests for save/load functionality
- [ ] Integration tests for procedural scene loading
- [ ] Performance testing with large save files
- [ ] Designer workflow validation

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All acceptance criteria verified and tested
- [ ] SaveStateConfiguration creates working save files
- [ ] Procedural scenes load correctly with saved parameters
- [ ] JSON save files are human-readable and editable
- [ ] Migration from old save system works seamlessly
- [ ] Unit tests achieve 80%+ coverage
- [ ] Designer workflow documented
- [ ] Performance requirements met (< 1s save/load time)

## Dependencies
- **Existing Save System**: Current PlayerData and SaveSystem classes
- **Procedural Generation**: PathGenerator and scene management systems
- **Currency System**: Meta/Perma currency implementation
- **Item System**: PurchasableItem and UnlockScriptableObject systems

## Risks and Mitigations
- **Risk**: Save file corruption during development
  - **Mitigation**: Robust backup system and validation
- **Risk**: Performance impact on large save files
  - **Mitigation**: Lazy loading and incremental saves
- **Risk**: Complexity of procedural state serialization
  - **Mitigation**: Phased implementation with fallbacks

## Demo Criteria
1. Create a SaveStateConfiguration with specific progression state
2. Configure a procedural scene set with custom seed
3. Apply configuration and show generated save file
4. Load game and demonstrate scene loading with correct state
5. Modify JSON externally and show successful reload

## Notes
- Save files located in: `GameData/NeonLadderSave.json`
- Supports external editing for advanced users and modding
- Visual configuration reduces barrier to entry for designers
- Integrates with existing roguelite progression systems
