# Boss Arena Scene Creation Guide

## 🎯 Overview
This guide provides step-by-step instructions for creating Boss Arena scenes - the final destinations in each procedural path. These scenes house the Seven Deadly Sins boss encounters and must handle victory/defeat scenarios properly with the Scene System.

## 📋 Prerequisites
- Scene System completed and merged (PR #138)
- Start.unity scene completed
- All 7 Connection1 scenes completed
- All 7 Connection2 scenes completed
- Unity Editor open with NeonLadder project
- Basic-Loadable-Scene-Template-v2.unity available

## 🗺️ Boss Arena Scene Types Needed

Create these 7 boss arena scenes matching the Deadly Sins:

| Sin | Boss Arena Scene Name | Environment Theme | Boss Character |
|-----|----------------------|-------------------|----------------|
| Gluttony | `Banquet.unity` | Infinite dining hall, food everywhere | Gluttony Boss |
| Pride | `Cathedral.unity` | Grand cathedral, stained glass, golden altar | Pride Boss |
| Wrath | `Necropolis.unity` | Graveyard arena, tombstones, dark atmosphere | Wrath Boss |
| Envy | `Mirage.unity` | Jewelry store, mirrors, reflective surfaces | Envy Boss |
| Lust | `Garden.unity` | Eden garden, paradise corrupted | Lust Boss |
| Sloth | `Lounge.unity` | Luxury lounge, comfortable but dangerous | Sloth Boss |
| Greed | `Vault.unity` | Bank vault, gold and treasure everywhere | Greed Boss |

## 🚀 Step-by-Step Implementation

### Step 1: Create Scene from Template

For **each** Boss Arena scene (repeat this process 7 times):

1. **Copy Scene Template**
   ```
   Navigate to: Assets/Scenes/Claude-Tests/
   Right-click: Basic-Loadable-Scene-Template-v2.unity
   Select: Duplicate
   Rename to: Banquet.unity (or appropriate name)
   ```

2. **Move to Proper Location**
   ```
   Drag scene file to: Assets/Scenes/
   (Keep it with other main game scenes)
   ```

3. **Open the Scene**
   ```
   Double-click: Banquet.unity
   ```

4. **Add to Build Settings**
   ```
   File → Build Settings
   Click: "Add Open Scenes"
   Verify scene appears in Scenes In Build list
   ```

### Step 2: Configure Core Components

1. **Verify Essential Prefabs**
   ```
   Check scene contains:
   ├── Managers.prefab (should exist from template)
   └── GameController.prefab (should exist from template)
   
   If missing: Drag from Assets/Prefabs/ into scene
   ```

2. **Scene Naming Verification**
   ```
   Scene name MUST match BossLocationData entries:
   Examples:
   - Banquet.unity ✓ (matches Gluttony)
   - Cathedral.unity ✓ (matches Pride)
   - Necropolis.unity ✓ (matches Wrath)
   - Mirage.unity ✓ (matches Envy)
   - Garden.unity ✓ (matches Lust)
   - Lounge.unity ✓ (matches Sloth)
   - Vault.unity ✓ (matches Greed)
   ```

### Step 3: Create Spawn Points

Create exactly **3 spawn points** for each Boss Arena scene:

#### SpawnPoint_FromRight (Entry from Connection2)
1. **Create GameObject**
   ```
   Right-click in Hierarchy → Create Empty
   Name: "SpawnPoint_FromRight"
   ```

2. **Add SpawnPoint Component**
   ```
   Add Component → Scripts → Gameplay → SpawnPoint
   ```

3. **Configure Component**
   ```
   SpawnPoint Component:
   ├── Spawn Point Name: "FromRight"
   ├── Direction: Left
   ├── Ground Layer: Default
   └── Use Ground Validation: ✓
   ```

4. **Position and Tag**
   ```
   Position: Arena entrance (where player enters from Connection2)
   Rotation: (0, 90, 0) - facing left toward boss arena center
   Tag: "SpawnPoint"
   ```

#### SpawnPoint_BossArena (Center Arena Spawn)
1. **Create GameObject**
   ```
   Right-click in Hierarchy → Create Empty  
   Name: "SpawnPoint_BossArena"
   ```

2. **Add SpawnPoint Component**
   ```
   Add Component → Scripts → Gameplay → SpawnPoint
   ```

3. **Configure Component**
   ```
   SpawnPoint Component:
   ├── Spawn Point Name: "BossArena"
   ├── Direction: Forward
   ├── Ground Layer: Default
   └── Use Ground Validation: ✓
   ```

4. **Position and Tag**
   ```
   Position: Center of boss arena (optimal combat position)
   Rotation: (0, 0, 0) - facing toward boss spawn location
   Tag: "SpawnPoint"
   ```

#### SpawnPoint_Default (Fallback)
1. **Create GameObject**
   ```
   Right-click in Hierarchy → Create Empty  
   Name: "SpawnPoint_Default"
   ```

2. **Add SpawnPoint Component**
   ```
   Add Component → Scripts → Gameplay → SpawnPoint
   ```

3. **Configure Component**
   ```
   SpawnPoint Component:
   ├── Spawn Point Name: "Default"
   ├── Direction: Forward
   ├── Ground Layer: Default
   └── Use Ground Validation: ✓
   ```

4. **Position and Tag**
   ```
   Position: Safe area near entrance (fallback spawn)
   Rotation: (0, 0, 0) - facing toward arena
   Tag: "SpawnPoint"
   ```

### Step 4: Create Boss Area

#### Boss Spawn Point
1. **Create GameObject**
   ```
   Right-click in Hierarchy → Create Empty
   Name: "BossSpawnPoint"
   ```

2. **Position Boss Spawn**
   ```
   Position: Opposite end of arena from player entrance
   Rotation: (0, 180, 0) - facing toward player spawn area
   Tag: "EnemySpawn" (or appropriate boss tag)
   ```

3. **Boss Arena Boundaries**
   ```
   Create invisible walls/colliders to contain the fight:
   - Arena should be large enough for combat
   - Prevent player from leaving during boss fight
   - Use BoxColliders (not triggers) for walls
   ```

### Step 5: Create Transition Triggers

Boss arenas need **2 main exit scenarios**:

#### VictoryExitTrigger (Boss Defeated)
1. **Create GameObject**
   ```
   Right-click in Hierarchy → Create Empty
   Name: "VictoryExitTrigger"
   ```

2. **Add BoxCollider (3D)**
   ```
   Add Component → Physics → Box Collider
   ```

3. **Configure Collider**
   ```
   Box Collider:
   ├── Is Trigger: ✓
   ├── Center: (0, 0, 0)
   └── Size: (3, 3, 1) - larger for easy access after victory
   ```

4. **Add SceneTransitionTrigger**
   ```
   Add Component → Scripts → Procedural Generation → Scene Transition Trigger
   ```

5. **Configure SceneTransitionTrigger**
   ```
   Scene Transition Trigger:
   ├── Transition Mode: Interactive
   ├── Direction: Any
   ├── Is One Way: ✗
   ├── Requires Key: ✓ (check this)
   ├── Required Key: "BossDefeated" (or boss-specific key)
   ├── Override Scene Name: "Start"
   ├── Override Spawn Point: "Default"
   └── Interactive Prompt: "Press E to Return to City"
   ```

6. **Position**
   ```
   Position: Center of arena or special victory location
   Initially: Set inactive (GameObject.SetActive(false))
   Activate: When boss is defeated via script
   ```

#### DefeatRespawnTrigger (Player Death)
**Note:** This trigger should be managed by the death/respawn system, not manually placed.

```csharp
// Example integration with death system:
// When player dies in boss arena, respawn at Connection2 entrance
// This should be handled by the GameController or death management system
```

### Step 6: Boss Integration Points

#### Steam Achievement Integration
Each boss arena should trigger achievements when boss is defeated:

1. **Add Achievement Trigger Script** (if available)
   ```
   // Example for Banquet.unity (Gluttony boss)
   // When boss dies, trigger: Achievement.GLUTTONY_SIN_DEFEATED
   ```

2. **BossLocationData Integration**
   ```
   Boss arena scenes should match BossLocationData entries:
   - Scene name matches location name in data
   - Boss spawn point coordinates match data (if specified)
   - Environmental elements match boss theme
   ```

### Step 7: Environmental Design Guidelines

Each boss arena should reflect its sin theme:

#### Banquet.unity (Gluttony)
```
Environment:
├── Dining tables with infinite food
├── Kitchen areas and serving stations
├── Food debris and overindulgence symbols
└── Rich, overwhelming color palette
```

#### Cathedral.unity (Pride)
```
Environment:
├── Gothic architecture with high ceilings
├── Stained glass windows
├── Golden altar and religious iconography
└── Grandiose, imposing atmosphere
```

#### Necropolis.unity (Wrath)
```
Environment:
├── Graveyard with tombstones
├── Dark, angry atmosphere
├── Cracked ground and dead trees
└── Red/black color scheme
```

#### Mirage.unity (Envy)
```
Environment:
├── Jewelry store with glass displays
├── Mirrors and reflective surfaces
├── Precious gems and envious symbols
└── Green-tinted lighting
```

#### Garden.unity (Lust)
```
Environment:
├── Paradise garden with lush vegetation
├── Flowing water and beautiful flowers
├── Corrupted Eden elements
└── Seductive, dangerous beauty
```

#### Lounge.unity (Sloth)
```
Environment:
├── Luxury furniture and comfort items
├── Dim, relaxing lighting
├── Elements of laziness and inactivity
└── Deceptively comfortable danger
```

#### Vault.unity (Greed)
```
Environment:
├── Bank vault with gold and treasure
├── Money and precious metals everywhere
├── Security elements (bars, locks)
└── Golden, overwhelming wealth display
```

## 🧪 Testing Boss Arena Scenes

### Test Scenario 1: Connection2 → Boss Arena
1. **Setup**
   ```
   Open any Connection2 scene
   Enter Play Mode
   ```

2. **Execute Test**
   ```
   Move player to LeftExitTrigger in Connection2 scene
   Should load corresponding boss arena
   Player should spawn at SpawnPoint_FromRight
   ```

### Test Scenario 2: Boss Victory → Return
1. **Setup**
   ```
   Open any boss arena scene manually
   Simulate boss defeat (activate VictoryExitTrigger)
   Enter Play Mode
   ```

2. **Execute Test**
   ```
   Move player to VictoryExitTrigger
   Should return to Start scene
   Player should spawn at appropriate spawn point
   ```

### Test Scenario 3: Arena Boundaries
1. **Setup**
   ```
   Open any boss arena scene
   Enter Play Mode
   ```

2. **Execute Test**
   ```
   Try to walk out of arena boundaries
   Player should be contained within combat area
   No unintended exits should be accessible during fight
   ```
