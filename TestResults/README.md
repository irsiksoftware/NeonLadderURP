# TestResults Directory

This directory contains Unity test execution results generated by Claude Code and the development team.

## Purpose
- Stores XML test results from Unity Test Framework executions
- Keeps test artifacts organized and out of the project root
- Provides a central location for CI/CD systems to collect test reports

## File Format
- `TestResults-*.xml` - Unity Test Framework XML output files
- Each file contains test execution results with timestamps

## Usage
When running tests via CLI or Claude Code automation, test results are exported here automatically.

## Git Configuration
All `*.xml` files in this directory are excluded from version control via `.gitignore`.
Only this README file should be committed.

## Automated Test Execution
Tests can be executed using:
```bash
"C:\Program Files\Unity\Hub\Editor\6000.0.26f1\Editor\Unity.exe" -batchmode -projectPath "C:\Users\Ender\NeonLadder" -executeMethod CLITestRunner.RunPlayModeTests -logFile "TestOutput/test_run.txt"
```

Results will be saved to: `C:/Users/Ender/AppData/LocalLow/ShorelineGames, LLC/NeonLadder/TestResults.xml`
